Kth Largest Element in an Array: Medium

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.



### Solution:   
quicksort  

``` python
class Solution:
    
    
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        
        def partition(A,start,end):
            pivot = A[end]
            Pindex  = start - 1
            for i in range(start,end):
                if (A[i] >= pivot):
                    Pindex = Pindex + 1
                    A[i],A[Pindex] = A[Pindex],A[i]

            A[Pindex+1], A[end] = A[end], A[Pindex+1]
            return Pindex + 1

        start = 0
        end = len(nums) - 1 
        while True:
            Pindex = partition(nums,start,end)
            if Pindex == k-1:
                return nums[Pindex]
            elif Pindex < k-1:
                start = Pindex +1
            else:
                end = Pindex - 1
