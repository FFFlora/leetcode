### 162. Find Peak Element - Medium

- A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

  Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

  You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.

  You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

   

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
  - `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
  - `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

##### My solution:
####Iterative
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1

    
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            midVal = nums[mid]
            if mid+1 == len(nums):
                return mid
            if midVal > nums[mid+1] and midVal> nums[mid-1]:
                return mid
            elif midVal > nums[mid+1] and midVal < nums[mid-1]:
                r = mid -1
            else: 
                l = mid + 1
                
        return -1
```

##### Notes

1. The tricky part for me was to believe - despite if the array is sorted or not - the the peak will always happens at the larger egde. Consider the `i` is found with the statement ` nums[i] < nums[i+1]` holds,the peak will only appears at the larger side - it'll either be `nums[i+1]` or the larger nums.
