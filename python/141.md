###  Linked List Cycle - Easy

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

Example 1:  

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```


Example 2:  

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```
Example 3:  

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

#### My Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
```
Notes: using quick and slow pointer, the idea is if the linked list has a loop, two pointer would ultimately meet somewhere.
