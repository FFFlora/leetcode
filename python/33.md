### 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array - Medium

- There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).

  Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

  Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return *the index of* `target` *if it is in* `nums`*, or* `-1` *if it is not in* `nums`.

  You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

   

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
  Output: 4
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
  Output: -1
  ```

  **Example 3:**

  ```
  Input: nums = [1], target = 0
  Output: -1
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  - `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
  - All values of `nums` are **unique**.
  - `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
  - `-104 <= target <= 104`

##### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
      
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            midVal = nums[mid]
            if midVal == target:
                return mid
            #check which side is in correct order
            if nums[l] <= midVal: 
                if nums[l] <= target < midVal:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            else:
                if midVal < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return -1
```

##### Note:

1. To deal with problems with `O(logn)`, there must be a binary search solution. 

2. The input array is at least half sorted - that's an advantage you can take. Always try to look for the item in the sorted side first, if it isn't there, must be in the other side.
