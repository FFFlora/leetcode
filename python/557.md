### Reverse Words in a String III - Easy

Given a string `s`, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` contains printable **ASCII** characters.
- `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.
- All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

#### Solution:

1. 

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split(' ')
        reverted = []
        for word in words:
        
            word = list(word) 
            i = 0
            j = len(word) - 1

            while i<=j:
                temp = word[i]
                word[i] = word[j]
                word[j] = temp
                result = ''.join(word)
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            reverted.append(result)
                
        return " ".join(reverted)
        	
```

        l, r = 0,0
        while r < len(s):

                r += 1
            else:
                if l != 0:
                    result = result + ' ' + s[l:r][::-1]
                else:
                    result += s[l:r][::-1]
                r = r + 1
                l = r
                
        if len(result) != 0:
            result = result + ' ' + s[l:r+1][::-1]
        else:
            result += s[l:r+1][::-1]

**Notes**:  
1. The first solution is not elegant nor efficient enough, as I figured it as a two pointers problem with the different direction. 
    
2. The second solution performs a little bit better, I used two pointers with same direction. I could further improve the code to let `" "` as part of the word when reverse, in this case the `result` would have `" "` in the begining, I could return `result[1:]` as the final result.
