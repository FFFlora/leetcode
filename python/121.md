###  121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - Easy

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

#### My Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        sorted_price = list(set(prices))
        sorted_price.sort()
        largest = max(prices)
        max_profit = 0
        for price in sorted_price:
            if max_profit + price >= largest:
                return max_profit
            pos = prices.index(price)
            if pos < len(prices) - 1:
                sell = max(prices[pos+1:])
                if sell - price > max_profit:
                    max_profit = sell - price 
        return max_profit 
```

##### Notes:

- The idea is to take all the unique values of the given list and then sort it, and then loop through this sorted list. First set the maximum value to 0. For each value in the sorted array, find its position in the original array, and find the potential largest value for the rest of the array, and then compare the difference of these two values as the profit with the maximum number, if the profit is larger than the maximum number, replace the maximum with new profit, otherwise continue the loop. In the maintime, within each loop, just if the current value plus the maximum exceeds the larget number of the array - if it does, there's no need to continue the loop.
