### Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - Medium

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

### My solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        if nums[left] < nums[right]:
            return nums[left]
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right)//2
            if nums[mid] < nums[right]:
                right = mid 
            elif nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1 
            else:
                return nums[right]
```
