### 189. Rotate Array - Medium

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

 

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

#### My solution:
####Iterative
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        pos = k % len(nums)
        nums[:] = nums[len(nums) - pos:] + nums[:len(nums) - pos]
        # nums = nums[len(nums) - k:] + nums[:len(nums) - pos]
        
```

##### Notes

1. This one is quite easy. The only mistake I made was instead of `nums[:] = nums[len(nums) - pos:] + nums[:len(nums) - pos]`, I put `nums = ...`, that way doesn't update the array at all.
