#### [618. Students Report By Geography](https://leetcode.com/problems/students-report-by-geography/), SQL, HardTable: Student

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the continent they came from.
```




A school has students from Asia, Europe, and America.

Write an SQL query to pivot the continent column in the Student table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia, and Europe, respectively.

The test cases are generated so that the student number from America is not less than either Asia or Europe.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

```Input: 
Student table:
+--------+-----------+
| name   | continent |
+--------+-----------+
| Jane   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jack   | America   |
+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+---------+------+--------+
| America | Asia | Europe |
+---------+------+--------+
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    | null | null   |
+---------+------+--------+
```


Follow up: If it is unknown which continent has the most students, could you write a query to generate the student report?



---

#### My Solution:

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT 
	MAX(CASE continent WHEN 'America' THEN name END),
  MAX(CASE continent WHEN 'Europe' THEN name END),
  MAX(CASE continent WHEN 'Asia' THEN name END)
 FROM (
	SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) as rk
  FROM Student 
 ) temp
GROUP BY rk;
```



##### Note:

1. To create columns using rows, the general solution is `GROUP BY` + `SUM/MAX/MIN(CASE WHEN)`, if it has primary id something like that. 

2. If it doesn't have primary id, the general solution should be like: `ROW_NUMBER(), GROUP BY, MAX(CASE...)`
