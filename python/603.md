### 603. Consecutive Available Seat, SQL, Easy

Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.

Return the result table **ordered** by `seat_id` **in ascending order**.

The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Cinema table:
+---------+------+
| seat_id | free |
+---------+------+
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
+---------+------+
Output: 
+---------+
| seat_id |
+---------+
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
+---------+
```

#### My solution:
```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT a.seat_id
FROM Cinema a JOIN Cinema b
ON ABS(a.seat_id - b.seat_id) = 1 AND a.free = 1 AND b.free = 1 
ORDER BY a.seat_id;
```



##### Note:

1. Use self join
1. Can add (more than 1) condition(s) directly when joining.
