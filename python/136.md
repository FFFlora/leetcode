###  136. Single Number - Easy

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

#### My Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if i == len(nums)-1:
                return nums[i]
            else:
                if nums[i] not in nums[i+1:]:
                    return nums[i]
                else:
                    i += 2
            
```

##### Notes:

- The idea is to sort the array first, and find if the `ith` element appears in the `nums[i+1:]`, if yes, then the pointer moves two steps to skip the next element; if not, then the current element is the one we are looking for.
