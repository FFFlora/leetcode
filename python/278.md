### First Bad Version - Easy

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```



#### Solution:

1. 

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return an integer
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = 1
        right = n 
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left+ right)//2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                if (mid == 1) or (isBadVersion(mid-1) == False):
                    return mid 
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
                    
            else:
                left = mid + 1
            
        # return left		
```

**Notes**:  

1. What confused me was the readiness of the problem. The API `isBadVersion` takes in the actually index of the product, which is a 1-indexed number, need to take this into consideration. Otherwise there'll be confusion in coding.
