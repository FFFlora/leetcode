#### [613. Shortest Distance in a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-line/),SQL, Easy

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
+-------------+------+
x is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-axis.
```




Write an SQL query to report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point table.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Input: 
Point table:
+----+
| x  |
+----+
| -1 |
| 0  |
| 2  |
+----+
Output: 
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1        |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is between points -1 and 0 which is |(-1) - 0| = 1.

```



Follow up: How could you optimize your query if the Point table is ordered in ascending order?

---

#### My Solution:

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT MIN(ABS(p2.x - P1.x)) shortest FROM
(    
    Point P1 JOIN Point P2 
    on P1.x != P2.x
)
```



##### Note:

1. Use self join
