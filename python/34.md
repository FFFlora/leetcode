### Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array - Medium

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
- `-109 <= target <= 109`

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        l,r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            midVal = nums[mid]
            if target < midVal:
                r = mid - 1
            elif target > midVal:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                start, end = mid, mid
                while (start>0) and (nums[start-1] == target):
                    start -= 1
                while (end < len(nums) -1) and (nums[end + 1] == target):
                    end += 1
                return [start, end]
        return [-1, -1]
```
