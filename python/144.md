### Binary Tree Preorder Traversal - Medium
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```python
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,2,3]
```
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

#### My solution:
#### Recursive

```python
class Solution:
    def preorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return
            result.append(node.val)
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)
        dfs(root)
        return result
```

#### Iterative
This method uses stack. The essence of stack is to **make the last things in recursion the first**.  
Stack is last-in, first-out, so whenever append item to stack, the item is on the top of the stack.

```python

class Solution:
    def preorderTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
        if not root: return
        stack = [root]
        result = []
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            result.append(node.val)
            if node.right:
                stack.append(node.right)
            if node.left:
                stack.append(node.left)
        return result
