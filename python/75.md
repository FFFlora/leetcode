75. Sort Colors - Medium

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
Follow up:

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.  
- First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
  Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space? 

### Notes:

```
[0,i): a
[i,j]: b
[j,k): elements needed to be check
[k,len-1]:c
```
```
a a | b | x x x | c 三个挡板四个区域
      i   j       k     
```
### Solution:

---
```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        
        if (len(nums)<=1):
            return

        i=0
        j=0
        k = len(nums)
        while(j<k):
            if nums[j] == 0:
                nums[i],nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
                i += 1
                j += 1
            elif nums[j] == 1:
                j += 1
            elif nums[j] == 2:
                k -=1
                nums[j],nums[k] = nums[k], nums[j]

```
