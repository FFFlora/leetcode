347. Top K Frequent Elements
Medium

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
Note:

    You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
    Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

### heapq
>`heapq.nlargest(n, iterable[, key])`
>Return a list with the n largest elements from the dataset defined by iterable. key,
>if provided, specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in the iterable:
>`key=str.lower` Equivalent to: `sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n]`
