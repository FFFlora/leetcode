### 344. Reverse String

Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is a printable ascii character.

**Follow up:** 

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

#### My Solution 

- Two pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        i, j = 0, len(s)-1
        while i<j:
            temp = s[i]
            s[i] = s[j]
            s[j] = temp
            i += 1
            j -= 1
            
```
