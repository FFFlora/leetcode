### 278. Move Zeros - Easy

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

#### Solution:

1. 

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        l, c = 0,0
        while l< len(nums):
            if nums[l] == 0:
                nums.remove(0)
                c += 1
            else:
                l += 1
        nums.extend([0]*c)
```

           zero = 0
           for i in range(len(nums)):
               if nums[i] != 0:
                   nums[i], nums[zero] = nums[zero], nums[i]
                   zero += 1

**Notes**:  

1. The idea of the first solution is to remove all the zeros as iterating, and add the zeros back by its count to the end of the array. The performance is not the best.
   
1. The idea of the second solution is as iterating the array, swap any non-zero element with the zero element till the end. It performs much more better.
