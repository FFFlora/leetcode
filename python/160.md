### Intersection of Two Linked Lists - Easy

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

Example 1:   
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)   
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3  
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8  
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). 
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. 
There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.  
```
 

Example 2:   
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)   
```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1  
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2  
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). 
From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. 
There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```
 

Example 3:   
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)   
```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2  
Output: null  
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. 
From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, 
while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```
 

Notes:
```

    If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
    The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
    You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
    Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
```

#### My Solution

1. hash: using dictionary 
```python
class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        p = headA
        q = headB
        stack = {} 
        while(p):
            stack[p] = 1
            p = p.next

        while(q):
            if q in stack:
                return q
            q = q.next
        return None
```

2. list concat

if concat the list as `A+B` and `B+A`, there would be a mutual part happen in the end of the list. 


```python

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        p = headA
        q = headB
        while p!=q:
            p = p.next if p else headB
            q = q.next if q else headA
        return q 
   ```
