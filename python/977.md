### 977. Squares of a Sorted Array - Easy

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return *an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

 

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?My solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        N = len(nums)
        arr = [0] * N
        pos = N - 1
        i, j = 0, N - 1

        while i <= j:
            if nums[i]**2 > nums[j]**2:
                arr[pos] = nums[i]**2
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[pos] = nums[j]**2
                j -= 1
            pos -= 1
        return arr
    
```

##### Note:

I didn't pay much attention to the condition that **"the array is sorted"**. If I could keep this in mind I would solve it faster, and in an easier way.
