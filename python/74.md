### 74. Search a 2D Matrix - Medium

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104`



#### My Solution:

---
```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        nums = [item for arr in matrix for item in arr]
        
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            midVal = nums[mid]
            
            if target == midVal:
                return True
            elif target < midVal:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
                
        return False
```

Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 9.90% of Python3 online submissions for Search a 2D Matrix.

Memory Usage: 14.7 MB, less than 65.77% of Python3 online submissions for Search a 2D Matrix.



Note:

1. flatten the array of arrays :

   ```python
   nums = [item for arr in matrix for item in arr]
   ```

   The outside array comes the first.
