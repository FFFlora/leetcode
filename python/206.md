### Reverse Linked List - Easy

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```
Follow up:   

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

#### My solution:
####Iterative
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev,curr = None, head
        while (curr):
            curr.next,prev,curr = prev, curr,curr.next
            
        return prev
```
