### 176. Second Highest Salary, SQL, Medium

Table: `Employee`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```

 

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```



### My solution:

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT IFNULL(
    (
    SELECT DISTINCT(salary)
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1,1
    ), NULL
) AS SecondHighestSalary
```

### Notes:

- `IFNULL(expression, alt_value)` returns a specified value if the expression is NULL.
- Use `LIMIT` to choose the specific value(s).
