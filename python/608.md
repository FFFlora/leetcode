### 176. Tree Node, SQL, Medium

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:

- **"Leaf"**: if the node is a leaf node.
- **"Root"**: if the node is the root of the tree.
- **"Inner"**: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

Write an SQL query to report the type of each node in the tree.

Return the result table **ordered** by `id` **in ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
| 2  | 1    |
| 3  | 1    |
| 4  | 2    |
| 5  | 2    |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
| 2  | Inner |
| 3  | Leaf  |
| 4  | Leaf  |
| 5  | Leaf  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: 
Node 1 is the root node because its parent node is null and it has child nodes 2 and 3.
Node 2 is an inner node because it has parent node 1 and child node 4 and 5.
Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are leaf nodes because they have parent nodes and they do not have child nodes.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/22/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: 
Tree table:
+----+------+
| id | p_id |
+----+------+
| 1  | null |
+----+------+
Output: 
+----+-------+
| id | type  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Root  |
+----+-------+
Explanation: If there is only one node on the tree, you only need to output its root attributes.
```

### My solution:

```SQL

SELECT id, 
CASE WHEN p_id is null THEN 'Root'
     WHEN id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Inner'
     ELSE 'Leaf'
     END 
     AS type
FROM tree;
```

### Notes:

- At first my solution was 

  ```sql
  SELECT id, 
  CASE WHEN p_id is null THEN 'Root'
       WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Leaf'
       ELSE 'Inner'
       END 
       AS type
  FROM tree;
  ```

  but couldn't figure out where went wrong. 

  After some research, I realize that the statement `SELECT p_id FROM tree` might contain `NULL`, take the first example, the set of the result returned from this statement is `(NULL,1,2)`, and `id NOT IN (SELECT...)` checks the condition if `id != NULL`. Based on the official doc, *You cannot use arithmetic comparison operators such as =, <, or <> to test for NULL*, all of such comparison would return` false`. Threrfore the statement `     WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree) THEN 'Leaf'` actually compares the `id` with `null` in some cases such as example 1.

- When use `CASE`, use `END`.
