#### [1164. Product Price at a Given Date](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-price-at-a-given-date/) - Medium

Table: Products

```
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
```




Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

```Input: 
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```





#### My solutions:

#### 
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT P1.product_id, IFNULL(P2.maxprice, 10) as price
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products ) AS P1
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT product_id, new_price maxprice FROM Products
    WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN (
        SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date)
        FROM Products
        WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
        GROUP BY product_id
    ) 
) AS P2 
ON P1.product_id = P2.product_id

```
##### Notes:

1. use `IFNULL`
