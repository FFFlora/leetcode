### Search Insert Position - Easy

 
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
```
Example 4:
```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0
```

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0 
        right = len(nums) -1 
        
        while left <= right:
            mid =(left+right)//2
            guess = nums[mid]
            if guess == target:
                return mid
            elif guess < target:
                left = mid + 1
            elif guess > target:
                right = mid - 1
        return left 
```
