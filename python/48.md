### 74. Rotate Image - Medium

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mat2.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`

#### My Solution:

---
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        matrix[:] = [[matrix[i][j] for i in range(len(matrix))] for j in range(len(matrix))] 
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            matrix[i].reverse()
        
```

Memory Usage: 14.2 MB, less than 61.04% of Python3 online submissions for Rotate Image.

##### Note:

1. The idea is to transpose the matrix first, and then reverse each row.
2. **In order to update the original matrix with list comprehension, need to address this way `matrix[:]=...`**
3. Side notes as review: flatten the array of arrays :

```python
nums = [item for arr in matrix for item in arr]
```

â€‹	The outside array comes the first.
