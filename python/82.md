82. ### Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II - Medium

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list*. Return *the linked list **sorted** as well*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

#### My Solution:

---
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        dummy = ListNode(0,head)
        cur = head
        pre = dummy
        while cur and cur.next:
            while cur.next and cur.val == cur.next.val:
                cur = cur.next
            if pre.next == cur:
                pre = pre.next
                
            else:
                pre.next = cur.next
                
            cur = cur.next

        return dummy.next
```

##### Note

1. Linked list in python is a blind point to me. It was hard for me to realize that the `head` is actually a node, that points to the following list, say, `[1,2,3,3,4,4,5]`. 

2. In python, linked list has shallow copy too.
3. Whenever deal with the linked list type of problem, consider the feasibility of `dummy` node first. Two pointers must have a dummy node.
