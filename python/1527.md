Example 1:

Input: 
Patients table:
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |

Explanation: Bob and George both have a condition that starts with DIAB1.
```

#### My solution:
```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT * FROM Patients 
WHERE conditions LIKE "% DIAB1%"  OR conditions LIKE "DIAB1%" 
```





##### Note:

- If there are multiple `LIKE` statements, need to seperated them out. 
- In a string, **space** is also a character, so don't ignore them.
