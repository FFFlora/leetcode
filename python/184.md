departmentId is a foreign key of the ID from the Department table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.
 

Table: Department

+-------------+---------+

| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.
 

Write an SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.
```

### My solution:

```SQL

SELECT D.name Department, E.name Employee, E.salary Salary 
FROM Employee E JOIN Department D
ON(E.departmentId = D.id)
WHERE salary IN (
    SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee
    WHERE departmentId = D.id)

```

```sql
SELECT Department, Employee, Salary FROM (
    SELECT D.name Department, E.name Employee, E.salary Salary, 
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY E.departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) as rk
    FROM Employee E JOIN Department D
    ON(E.departmentId = D.id)) t
WHERE rk = 1
    
```



### Notes:

- Method 1 is regular solution 
- Method 2 uses WINDOW function `RANK()`
