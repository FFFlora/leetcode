### Two Sum - Easy

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

#### Solution:

1. 

```
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        rdict = {}
        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            temp = target - n
            if temp not in rdict:
                rdict[n] = i
            else:
                return [rdict[temp],i]
```

            diff = target - num
            tempNums = nums[i+1:]
            if diff in tempNums:
                return[i,tempNums.index(diff)+i+1]

**Notes**:  
1. At the first glance I was wondering if the list is sorted, 
  but then I realize usually when the prompt is not specifying if it is sorted, then in most cases the order doesn't matter much.

2. The time complexity to check for an item in a **dictionary** is **O(1)**, and in a **list is O(n)**.
