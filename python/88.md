### 88. Merge Sortes Array - Easy  

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be *stored inside the array* `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109`

 

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

#### Solution:  

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        nums1[m:] = nums2
        
        i, j = 0, m
        while i < m+n and j <= m +n -1:
            if i == j:
                if j < m+n - 1:
                    j += 1
                if j == m+n - 1:
                    break
                    
            if nums1[i] >= nums1[j]:
                elm = nums1.pop(j)
                nums1.insert(i,elm)
                j += 1
                
            else:   
                i += 1
        print(nums1)
```

##### Notes

- Trying to avoid the `sort()` method here. 

- The idea of my solution is, first, combine the arrays into `nums1`, and then insert all elements from the later half of the `nums1` at the right position. Since the two halves of the array are sorted already, just need to compare each of the element from the second half with the first half elements, once find the right position, pop the element from the second half, and then insert it in the right position. The key is after the insertion, the position of the current element of the second half array, which is `j` in this case, needs to increase 1, to continue with the comparson process.
